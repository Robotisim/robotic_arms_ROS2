Welcome to the Robotic Arms with ROS2 wiki!
From side-bar access all projects individually and in more detail to run on your systems .

### Project #1: 6DOF Kuka Arm ROS2 and Moveit2 control:
This package contains KUKA robotic arm using ROS2 and Moveit2. It includes capabilities for visualizing the robot's state, simulating its behavior in a 3D environment, planning and executing movements, and controlling the robot's actions. The package leverages several powerful tools in the ROS2 ecosystem, including RViz2 for visualization, Gazebo for simulation, and MoveIt2 for motion planning and control.


### Project #2: Baxter Multi Arm Robot Moveit2 Manipulating:
 This project is currently under development.

### Project #3: 4 DOF Robotic Arm ROS2 Hardware Interfacing:
 This project is currently under development.
